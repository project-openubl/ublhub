            🚀 Container image Preview ✨

            The creation of the container image might take aproximately 10 minutes. Once it is available you can pull it using:
            ```shell
            docker pull ghcr.io/${{github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name}}/${{github.event.repository.name}}:${{github.event.pull_request.head.ref}}
            ```
